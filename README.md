# Multiversity App
## AI Education Systems

This evolving frontend is based on a [NextJS template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/openai-assistants-quickstart) from Vercel. Our platform enables teachers to create and share customizable tutor bots, without having to code.

### Building the App

1. Clone repo and navigate to that directory
```
git clone https://github.com/MultiversityAI/app.git && cd app
```

2. Install dependencies using Node.js
```
npm install
```

3. Run tests and view changes locally in your browser
```
npm run dev
```

> Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app when running.

### Assistants API -- OpenAI

An assistant is a purpose-built AI that has specific instructions, leverages additional knowledge, and can call models and tools to perform tasks.

OpenAI built this [Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) on the same capabilities that enable their [GPTs product](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts).

A key feature is persistent and infinitely long threads, which allow developers to hand off thread state management to OpenAI and work around context window constraints. *With the Assistants API, you simply add each new message to an existing thread.*

Assistants also have access to call new tools as needed, including:

- **Code Interpreter:** writes and runs Python code in a sandboxed execution environment, and can generate graphs and charts, and process files with diverse data and formatting. It allows your assistants to run code iteratively to solve challenging code and math problems, and more.
- **Retrieval:** augments the assistant with knowledge from outside the OpenAI models, such as proprietary domain data, product information or documents provided by your users. This means you donâ€™t need to compute and store embeddings for your documents, or implement chunking and search algorithms.
- **Function Calling:** enables assistants to invoke functions you define and incorporate the function response in their messages.

> ***[Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy):** OpenAI never uses data and files passed to their API to train models, and developers can delete the data when they see fit.*
